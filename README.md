# Linux Security Hardening with Ansible

This repository provides a collection of Ansible playbooks to implement security best practices for Linux servers. The playbooks automate the process of configuring and hardening your system based on industry-standard security guidelines.

## Features

- **Automates Security Configurations:** Leverage Ansible to automate hardening tasks, minimizing manual errors.
- **SSH Security:** Enforces SSH best practices, restricts root access, and implements key-based authentication.
- **User Management:** Configures user privileges, enforces strong password policies, and controls user sessions.
- **Firewall Settings:** Manages firewall configurations using `iptables` or `firewalld`.
- **Configurable for Different Linux Distributions:** Supports RedHat, CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/linux-security-hardening.git
   ```

2. **Update Inventory File:**

   Edit the `inventory` file to include the list of target servers:

   ```
   [servers]
   server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=root
   server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=root
   ```

3. **Run the Playbook:**

   Execute the playbook against your target servers:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
   ```

## Best Security Practices Implemented

- **Set GRUB Password:** Protect GRUB from unauthorized modifications.
- **Create Separate Partitions:** Separate critical directories (e.g., `/home`, `/var`, `/tmp`) to enhance security.
- **Minimize Installed Packages:** Remove unnecessary software to reduce the attack surface.
- **Check Open Network Ports:** Regularly audit open ports using `netstat` or `ss`.
- **Secure SSH Configuration:** Limit SSH access, disable root login, and restrict to key-based authentication.
- **Enable Firewalls:** Use `iptables`, `ufw`, or `firewalld` to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Use SELinux or AppArmor:** Enforce Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies.
- **Enable System Logging:** Ensure logging is enabled and monitored.
- **Disable Unused Filesystems:** Prevent loading of unnecessary filesystem modules.
- **Disable IPv6 if Unused:** Disable IPv6 if it’s not needed to reduce the attack surface.
- **Regularly Update Software:** Automate software updates with `yum-cron` or `unattended-upgrades`.
- **Restrict Cron and At Jobs:** Limit cron jobs to privileged users.
- **Implement Strong Password Policies:** Use PAM modules to enforce password complexity.
- **Monitor User Activities:** Track user activities using `auditd` or `logwatch`.
- **Disable Unnecessary SUID Programs:** Identify and remove unnecessary SUID and SGID binaries.
- **Limit Root User Access:** Restrict root access using `sudo` and implement role-based access control.
- **Protect `/boot` Directory:** Make `/boot` immutable to prevent kernel modifications.
- **Disable USB Storage:** Prevent unauthorized devices from being mounted.
- **Configure SSH Banner:** Display a security banner for SSH logins.
- **Backup Critical Data:** Regularly backup critical files and system configurations.
- **Use Intrusion Detection Systems:** Implement `fail2ban` or `AIDE` for intrusion detection.
- **Implement NIC Bonding:** Improve network redundancy and reliability.
- **Disable Ctrl+Alt+Del:** Prevent accidental or malicious reboots from the console.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Automate regular security scans using tools like `Lynis` or `OpenSCAP`.
- **Disable GUI Services:** Remove graphical services on servers to reduce resource usage.
- **Use PAM for Security Policies:** Implement Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for advanced policies.
